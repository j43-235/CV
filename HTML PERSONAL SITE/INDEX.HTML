        <p>I am currently in my 2nd year of university studying BSc sports and exercise science at Coventry university. Over the duration of my course I have had the opportunity of working alongside professional athletes such as football players
          running
          test to provide feedback which would be beneficial for their training. I have developed a number of skills as a result of working with athletes which is communication, confidence and my IT skills which are vital when providing feedback as
          their
          progress is determined by your analysis of results produced. My interest in the field of sport performance analysis has grew as a result of my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/covuniHLS/videos/988649904816302/">previous opportunities</a>
          which
          has fuelled my passion to work alongside athletes to ensure correct
          measures are made which enables athletes to produce optimal performances. </p>
